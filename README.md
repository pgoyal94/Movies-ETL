# Movies-ETL

We helped Britta extract, transform and load (ETL) movie data from multiple sources into a singular location. Amazing Prime wants to keep the dataset of Wikipedia data and Kaggle data updated on a daily basis. We helped Britta to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. We created one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
